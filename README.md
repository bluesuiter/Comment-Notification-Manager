# Comment-Notification-Manager
When someone leaves comment on a WordPress post, the system sends a notification e-mail to the author of particular post. By this way, whenever a comment is published, post writer get informed about comment and can response immediately.

However, sometimes you may want to change the receiver of that notification email, for solving this purpose we introduced this plugin. Please, let know your suggestions and feedback.
